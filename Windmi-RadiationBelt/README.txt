# GET STARTED

Getting started is pretty easy make sure that the data folder is empty.
if it isn't this is old data and you need to remove it and replace it with the new data that you want to work on!

Please do not store this data under different names or in the Windmi GOES data directory. Please delete or remove it entirely from the directory.

Once you have placed all of the files listed above in the "data" directory all you have to do is run main.m and it will output all of the data for you.
